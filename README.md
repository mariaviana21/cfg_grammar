# CFG grammar for Galician
Context-free grammars (CFGs) are useful because they provide a formal and precise way to describe the structure of a language. They are commonly used in computer science and linguistics to model programming languages, natural languages, and other formal languages.

A little overview of the reasons to use CFG grammars:
- They provide a framework for parsing, which is useful for language processing tasks such as syntactic analysis, machine translation, and speech recognition.
- They can also be used to generate sentences or programs that are grammatically correct. This is useful in natural language generation, code generation, and other applications where it is necessary to produce valid output.
- CFGs are used to prove theorems and establish the properties of different classes of formal languages.
- CFGs can be used to model the syntax of natural languages and programming languages. This can help researchers better understand the structure of these languages and develop more accurate language models for tasks such as machine translation and natural language processing.

The CFG I created for Galician is only a first approximation, open to improvement.
